# Tooling

Creating a Nørd application involves more than just writing code. To ensure a better Developer Experience (DX), we recommend a set of tools designed to enhance productivity, code quality, and collaboration. These tools are integral in managing complex projects, maintaining code standards, and streamlining the development process.

## Code Editor: VS Code

[Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a powerful, extensible code editor. Its rich set of extensions for JavaScript, TypeScript, and web development, along with built-in support for Git, make it an ideal choice for developing Nørd applications.

### Extensions

-   Prettier: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules.
-   [FAST Tagged Template Literals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-fast.fast-tagged-templates): A fast, tagged template literal syntax highlighting extension.

::: info
There is no official `Nørd`-extension yet, but we are working on it.
